# Components for a sports website

Welcome to the documentation for the Components for a sports website.
This project provides components specifically designed
for sport-themed websites. Data from a soccer league was used for the demonstration,
but you can use the components for different sports. Using these components,
you can easily create consistent and visually appealing UI elements for your
sport-related web applications.

## Available Components

__Game card__: display information about sports events, including teams, date and time.

__Statistic component__: display the statistics of each team for the game. For example _fouls_, _yellow cards_, _offsides_, _shots_, etc.

## Example of usage
### Game card

```jsx
import GameCard from "./components/GameCard";
import formatDateTime from "./assets/functions";

function App() {
    return (
        <GameCard
            theme='dark'
            score='1:0'
            firstTeamInfo='Chornomorets'
            secondTeamInfo='Dnipro-1'
            dateTime={formatDateTime(new Date(2023,2,23,17,0))}
        />
    )
}
```
